# Factorial Calculator

## Overview

This repository contains a RESTful service that calculates factorials of given integers using goroutines. 
The service utilizes the httprouter package for creating the server and provides an endpoint for factorial calculation.
The service will start and listen on port 8989.

## Usage

* To run this project use `go run cmd/main.go`
* To run all tests use `go test ./...`
* To run linter use `golangci-lint run ./...`



## API Endpoint

### `POST /calculate`

* Request JSON Structure: {"a": int, "b": int}
* Response JSON Structure: {"factorial A": uint64, "factorial B": uint64}
The endpoint calculates the factorials of a and b using goroutines and returns a JSON response with the calculated values.

### Request

To test the API, you can use the curl command-line tool to make POST requests, like this:

`curl localhost:8989/calculate -d {\"a\":6,\"b\":12}`

This command sends a JSON request with the parameter a & b set to 6 & 12 to the server's /calculate endpoint, and it will return a pair of factorials.
